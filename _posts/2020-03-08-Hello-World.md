There are things everybody knows, there are things that many people know, there are things that few people know and there are things that only one person knows.

At the moment, this feels like a pretty magical place. Pretty much everyone, everywhere has access to this blog, but nobody has read it.
Like things in ancient history, mentioned once and then never again, this blog is under the surface of things that are available to anybody at all. 

Hopefully though, this is a temporary state and soon somebody tries to read something I've written. Until, this will stay in the weird state of not being known to anybody.
