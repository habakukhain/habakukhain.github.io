I've been planning on a trip to Lisbon for some time. Last time, I wanted to go, was in the midst of the Corona crisis of 2020, so I ended up staying at home and imagining, what I would've done, were I able to travel. 

I am writing this post, because generally don't like travel recommendations. To me they usually seem pretentious and often times not interesting or flat-out boring.
