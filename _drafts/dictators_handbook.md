## Introduction
In its introduction, Bruce Bruno de Mesquita and Alistair Smith quickly introduce a very easy and intuitive example of Bell, California and try to prime the idea of an understanding of politics centered around the individual.

They briefly vet this idea against the ideas of the great political thinkers of the past (Hobbes, Montesquieu, Madison, Macchiavelli). Macchiavelli gets the best grades by being most cynical, which Smith, de Mesquita and myself think is the right way to think about the world and politics. 

A central idea in the introduction is the number of people needed in order to sustain a (political) leadership. They say: if you only need few people, then you can bribe them easily and it's in everybodies self-interest to keep quiet / keep supporting. 

Also the main protagonists of this school of thought are: de Mesquita, Smith, 
Randolph M. Silverson, James D. Morrow (Authors of "The logic of political survival")

### Key claim
No nations, organizations, businesses have interests, but people leading them do. The structure of their incentives moderates the behaviour they show when they rule

### Key example
Bell, California had a city manager (Robert Rizzo, later charged with curruption), who extracted large amounts of money for himself and some cronies by (a) taking away state-level control by changing the cities status from *regular city* to *charter city*, (b) using his new-found powers to levy high taxes on the mostly poor people of Bell, (c) pay his cronies large sums of money for supporting him politically, and (d) manipulating (mostly the timing of) elections in order to need very few votes to be elected.

### Key mechanism
No real explanations here. But suggested: Few people deciding who is governed with little oversight is not a good thing, especially because if you decide who controls you, you can do whatever.

Secondly, implied mechanism how meritocracy might be extremely useful in keeping a liberal democracy stable: The most ambitious and resourceful individuals are usually the most likely to high-jack institutions and become their leaders to reap personal benefits. Make them rich and they don't need to overthrow your government. 

Thirdly, having a lot of cronies to chose from, makes it easier for a leader to extract: you don't have to pay the cronies too much, because they can bea readily replaced

### Key passages

I loved this Macchiavelli quote:
>[Anyone seeking to establish a rulership of liberty will fail unless] he withdaws from the general equality a number of the boldest and most ambitious spirits, and makes gentlemen of them, not merely in name but in fact, by giving them castles and possessions, as well as money and subjects; so that surrounded by these he may be able to maintain his power, that by his support they may satisfy their ambition...

Also, great section is 'general lessons from Bell', which I guess subsumises most of their book
>Bell presents a number of lessons to teach us about the rules to rule by.
First, politics is about getting and keeping political power. It is not about general welfare of "We, the people."
Second, political survival is best assured by depending on few people to attain and retain office. That means, dictators dependent on a few cronies, are in a far better position to stay in office for decades, often dying in their sleep, than are democrats.
Third, when the small group of cronies hoping to replace them in the queue for gorging at the public trough, then the top leadership has great discretion over how revenue is spent and how much to tax. All that tax revenue and discretion opens the door to kleptocracy from many leaders, and public-spirited programs from a very few. And it means enhanced tenure in power. 
Fourth, dependence on a small coalition liberates leaders to tax at high rates, just as was true in Bell. Taxing at high rates has a propensity to foment the threat of popular uprising, just as happened in Bell, 

## Chapter 1: The rules of politics
In this chapter, the authors begin to describe their main fraimwork. The idea is that the supporter structure of leaders is a major determinant of their policy later. 

They start of by explaining that no ruler rules alone, but is dependent on supporters and selectors.

The key distinction here is the stratification of the s/electorate in three groups:

(i) the nominal selectorate or *interchangables* are those who have a theoretical say in who becomes leader. In democracies (or "rigged-election autocracies") this group becomes pretty large. They present a pool from which the ruler can select supporters, or better *draw* their real selectorate by choosing clever policies, manipulation selection processes and targeting welfare efforts.

(ii) The real selectorate or *influentials* are those who have a real say in who gets selected as a leader. Think of it in terms of democracies: most of the voters' votes don't do much to change the policies of a given leader, especially not if they are cast for an opposing party. Say, you have two options for a leader, *A* and *B*, and *A* wins the vote with 51% (*influentials*) of the votes, then 49% (*interchangables*) of the votes -- those that went to *B* -- are not important for *A* to govern. Their preferences won't play such a big role in *A*'s considerations of what policies to implement and which programs to spend money on, only as so far as they are a replacement for illoyal *influentials* or *essentials*.
Note that the proportions are only this close if you live in a democracy. In an authoritarian regime, it is easily conceivable to have a vast number of *interchangables*, but a tiny number of *influentials*.

(iii) The "winning coalition" or *essentials* are those people whose "votes" actually determines the winner or loser of a power struggle. In a democracy those people are the tiny amount of people who actually give one potential leader the edge over the other. In an autocracy those people might be military leaders and influential political personel. 

The main point here is: leaders need to spend most of their resources on the *essentials*, at the same time keeping the pool of potential replacements large. The simple logic is that your key supporters would much rather *be* you than to *be with* you. In this sense, it is crucial for a leader to keep the supporters loyal by giving them the perspective of being replaced by commoners. 

This is also directly relevant for the question of *how much* resources a given ruler can raise to give to his/her supporters. If you are dependent on the goodwill of the many (as in some well-functioning democracies),you better not tax the masses to high in order to give to some currupt officials (what kind of influence are you buying anyways?). If you don't need many supporters to survive, then it suddenly becomes a great idea to steal from the masses to give to your supporters. 

They make five rules, illustrating these kinds of incentives:
>(i) Keep your winning coalition as small as possible
>
>(ii) Keep your nominal selectorate as large as possible
>
>(iii) Control the flow of revenue
>
>(iv) Pay your key supporters just enough to keep them loyal
>
>(v) Don't take money out of your supporters' pockets to make the people's lives better

### Key claim(s)
Rulers of any flavor are dependent on those that select them and keep them in power. The selectorate is universally stratified in the real selectors and those standing in line to replace them. The structure of the selectorate crucially determines the constraints and incentives a leader has, independent of ideological considerations. 

### Key example(s)
Some great ones here:

(i) Louis XIV on the point of having a large pool of *interchangables*. Louis XIV ruled >70 years. Establishing new aristocrats (*noblesse de robe*) threatening old aristocrats (*noblesse d'e'pe'e*). Expanding the role of commoners in the civil service and military. Forcing the aristocrats to stay at the cort, removing them from their own power structures and resources at home. 

(ii) Harvey Milk on the point of the significance of the size of the electorate in democracies. Harvey Milk (first openly gay office holder in the modern West, elected to serve on the San Francisco city council in 1977) only won after a change in election laws, resulting in the election of council members district-wise and not city-wise. He had lost the election two years earlier -- albeit getting 10 times as many votes. In his district, in the end \~5000 sufficed to give him the council position. He was assassined two years later.

(iii) Fidel Castro and Che Guevarra on the dangers of being a replacable supporter. After Che became too popular and strong of a figure in the Cuban post-revolutionary government, Fidel sent him to Bolivia, where Fidel cut off support, leading to Che being caputered and finally executed. This was not the sole fate of Che though, as Fidel had most of his revolutionary supporters exiled or executed not long after he had the power in Cuba. 

### Key section(s)  

On why empty bank accounts are not good:
>While most of us think of a state's bancruptcy as a financial crisis, looking through the prism of political survival makes evident that it really amounts to a political crisis. When debt exceeds the ability to pay, the problem for a leader is not so much that good public works must be cut back, but rather that the incumbent doesn't have the resources necessary to purchase political loyalty from key backers. Bad economic times in a democracy mean too little money to fund pork-barrel projects that buy political popularity. For kleptocrats it means passing up vast sums of money, and maybe even watching their secret bank accounts dwindle along with the loyalty of their underpaid henchmen.

On why democratic officials are not well paid:
>Though we may willingly pay taxes for programs that provide tangible benefits to us, for instance protection from fire, felons and foreign foes, we would not be willing to see our tax money used to pay a tremendous salary to our president or prime minister -- or, in the case of Bell, California, to our local government officials. As a result, heads of government reliant on a large coalition tend not to be among the world's best paid executives.

On what to spend money on:
>Kleptocrats of course, sock the money away in secret bank accounts or in offshore investments to serve as a rainy day fund in the event that they are overthrown. A few civic-minded autocrats slip a little into secret accounts, preferring to fend off the threat of revolt by using their discretionary funds (the leftover tax revenue not spent on buying coalition loyalty) to invest in public works. Those public works may prove successful, as was true for Lee Kwan Yew's efforts in Singapur or Deng Xiopings's in China. They may also prove to be dismal failures, as was true for Kwame Nkrumah's civic-minded industrial program in Ghana or Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward, which turned out to be a great leap backwards for China. 

Why again would they do this? I think there is more interesting things to learn, specifically about Singapur and Ghana. 

## Chapter 2: Coming into power
Extremely enjoyable to read, great examples and insights into how people gain power. Most of the chapter focused on issues in autocratic lines of succession and how they might be exploited. 

The main idea here is that for you to become a ruler, usually an old ruler has to be gotten rid of in one of several ways:

(i) they could die

(ii) they could lose the supporters and you could gain them

(iii) they could be disposed from the outside. 

The chapter specifically focus on (ii) and a bit of (i), specifically in respect of getting rid of rivals, which is in some case similar to getting rid of an old ruler.

Furthermore, dM/A focus on things to do right after getting into "office". 
The basic observation here is that the main *incumbent bonus* a sitting ruler has, is that he knows where the money and resources are, i.e. that he can somewhat guarantee to pay off his supporters. For a challenger to win, they need to make a convincing case, that they are able to provide the same or better benefits **or** there have to be realistic doubts about the ability of the old guard to provide the benefits into the future, i.e. sickness and intransparent succession or bankruptcy. 

Recognizing this, a new ruler has to establish their power quickly, i.e. take over the revenue and pay their supporters, or even a relatively unconvincing promise of a rival will sound plausible and attractive. 

Finally, dM/A note a few nice design features of democracies:
(i) while in autocratic systems, the means of getting of an incumbent and becoming a new ruler are mostly independent (i.e. B could dispose of ruler A, but this would not necessitate B becoming new ruler, as killing an old ruler does not give immediate claim to power), in democracies the act of disposing and old ruler also establish a new winning coalition, which help the designated leader to actually come to power. 

(ii) in democracies, revolt is less attractive, because there are so many supporters that being in the winning coalition is only little better than being outside of it

(iii) while competition in autocratic systems means being demonstrably stronger and able to extract more resources to pay supporters off, in democracies competition means coming up with better ways to make popular public policy -- something you would probably want in a system of government, as it is likely to make your life better. 

### Key claims
- The reason revolts succeed are usually because they are allowed to succeed by disgruntled *essentials* of the *ancien regime* (usually because they are not paid anymore or expect to not be paid in the future)
- Getting rid of rivals is a good idea for any aspiring autocrat. Thus, if you want to (i) not be dead immediately once you become old and sick and less importantly (ii) avoid chaos once you're gone, then designate a plausible successor.
- The reason why dynasties are so popular is that usually the mother can teach the daughter / the father can teach the son where the resources are to keep paying off the supporters. 


### Key examples
A lot of great ones:

(i) Salomon Doe and having no special talent in order to dispose an old ruler. Salomon Doe was literally a simple soldier, serving in the military, when he randomly stumbled upon the sleeping president of Liberia in 1980. Killing him swiftly made him new president. He then was good at extraction, generating new sources of revenue and keping his military paid, such that he could keep the office, without ever having any qualification, whatsoever. He was finally disposed once the US stopped paying him for having a military base in Liberia and he was not able to keep his supporters in line. In the end, neighboring autocrats, attracted by Liberias resources and the riches of Salomon Doe, captured him without much counterforce.

(ii) Khomeini and waiting until you can make a move. Khomeini was a popular leader in the opposition ot the shah's regime in the 1960s, going into exile in 1964. He came back once the old shah was ousted in 1977, Khomeini came back to take control. Why did he only come back then? Because before, the shah guaranteed his supporters goodies, making a rebellion look unlikely to succeed from the start. Why did the shah suddenly stop? He didn't, but the *New York Times* wrote about his battle with cancer, making his supporters nervous that at one point, they would need to look for a leader giving them goodies. 

(iii) The Aquinos and how to (not) deal with sickness. Short: Mr. Aquino was very talented and quickly rising politician, immediately executed once he challenged the Phillipines dictator Marcos. His less stellar wife succeeded a few years later in 1986, because Marco was (rather publicly) in bad physical shape due to lupus and his supporters abandoned him.

(iv) Laurent Kabila and also how to deal with sickness. Kabila gained control over Zaire, after the military did not fight back. The military did not fight back, because the leader Mobuto Sese Seko had postate cancer and was unlikely to support them for much longer. The fun part of this story is that Che Guevarre apparently really did not like Kabila, describing him as "lacking revolutionary seriousness" and being "too addicted to alcohol and women".

(v)  Kim Jong Il and Fidel Castro, and how deal with sickness from a rulers perspective. Here, some parallels. Kim Jong Il pretty unambiguously installed Kim Jong Un when he became sick, making him a general and giving him control over parts of government. Fidel Castro named his brother Raul successor when he became sick from liver cancer.

(vi) The ottomans and how to establish an efficient succession regime. Apparently, the ottoman empire was ruled for hundreds of years in a system of fratericide, as, after the sultans death, all of his sons were racing to the capital, trying to secure the resources necessary to pay off the army. To eliminate competition, they then killed their brothers, who might also seek power. This was then even made into a law, demanding that all the brothers of the ruler were killed by Mehmet II in the 1400s. In the 17th century, this law was liberalized, demanding that the brothers were only kept in the *golden cage* of the Tokapi palace. I think, I have read this example better elsewhere. Maybe *Why nations fail*?

(vii) Richard III and what to do with your nephews. Short: Richard III. was the brother of King Edward IV., responsible for the underage sons after the kings death. Sons were killed, the legitimacy of the late kings marriage was questioned and Richard was king. 

(viii) Damasus and how to found an institution surviving millenia and at the same time not pissing off any important people. Damasus was the pope to bring the center of the Christian church to Rome. He gained control by being pleasant to the (mostly pagan) elites, while pissing off the Christian plebs. He was anyways declared pope, as opposed to the competitor Ursinus, because the elites were able to fight an insurgency back. He then played nice with the wives of the elites, converting them to Christianity (maybe missionary style?), giving him power and sway in Rome. 

(ix) Czar Nicholas II. and how to fight alcoholism. Czar Nicholas banned Vodka in 1917, because he thought it would benefit his war efforts. Apparently, this cut away a significant part of his revenue, as the vodka tax made up up to a third of his income. This loss of money made him unable to pay the army protecting the Winter Palace, leading to a cold rest of the winter for the Romanows in Yekatarinburg. 

(x) Ben Bella and keeping your mouth shut. Ben Bella was leader of Algeria after the war of independence. One day he announced a meeting of the politburo a week later, with an attached agenda implying that he would get rid of most of his supporters. His supporters not happy about it, staged a coup and had a week to plan it.

### Key passages

On the problem of succession. 
>Buying loyalty is particularly difficult when a leader first comes into power. When deciding whether to support a new leader, prudent backers must not only think about how much their leader gives them today. They must also ponder what they can expect to receive in the future. 

On the advantages on inheritance.
>Inheritance holds a number of advantages for leaders and their supporters alike. Paying off the right people is the essence of good government -- and princes are well equipped to continue to reward supporters. They know where the money is and who to pay off. Even so, why should the court be so keen to go along with inheritance? After all, if the prince takes the top job, then the other courtiers cannot be king (or dictator or president) in his place. Supporting inheritance inevitably means giving up the chance to become king yourself. Yet, that is just one side of the calculation. With so many people who would like to be king, the chance of landing the top job is tiny. In reality, supporters of the late king are often best off to elevate his son and hope that he then dances with the one that brought him to the ball.

### Chapter 3: Staying in Power

A chapter in which dM/A focus on the kind of coalition building required for leaders to stay in office. 

The theme here is, that coalitions bringing a leader to power are also likely to depose them. 

For autocrats, such as CEOs of publicly traded companies, consolidating power usually means replacing *essentials* with friends and families, specifically making the amount of people they rely on smaller and more disposable. 

Obviously, the supporters to do not like this usually (see Ben Bella example in the last chapter), so the autocrat has to plan carefully and usually present a *fait accompli*. 

Another point regarding the selection of *essentials* for an autocrat, is that competence is usually not desirable, as competent supporters are also competent rivals. This might be a reason, why autocratic regimes seem to have such incompetent ministers. 
Since incompetent supporters have their downsides, sometimes it is also good to choose supoorters that cannot establish themselves in power for other reasons (eunuchs who cannot build a line of succession or members of religious minorities who would not be able to gain politcal authority, no matter how hard they tried)

For democrats, who want to stay in power, other stategies work much better, such as *bloc voting*, in which a block of voters commits itself to vote for one party or *gerrymandering*, discussed elsewhere in much greater detail. 


In this context, some more interesting points are made on publicly traded companies: Companies usually have a large pool of *interchangables*, who have little sway over actual company policy. The *essentials* for selecting a CEO are usually the board members, while the *influentials* are those investors who have enough stock to actually influence company policy. 
Now, to secure support of the essentials, CEOs can usually either distribute *public goods* (higher stock price, dividends) or *private goods* (paid positions in board or management). Small shareholders much prefer a higher stock price to a higher management salary, but luckily for them, large individual shareholders also sometimes prefer public goods (because they are the ones gaining the most from them). Still, the ability of CEOs to bribe their way into staying in power, sometimes means ludicrous compensation for board members and management. 
One amazing point here is the analogy to *bloc voting* (see below) for institutional shareholders (think retirement funds). Since the people governing the institutions and therefore the votes the shares bring, have little to gain personally from the *public goods*, they are much easier to bribe with lucrative positions. 

Another interesting point on *bloc voting*: If you have established voting blocs (think geographical or ethnical communities, unions, etc.), it makes very little sense for individuals in these blocs to change their vote. If a winning party gives perks to the blocs based on their unusually high turnout and support, for each individual it makes a lot more sense to keep the support high, yielding more perks, than to vote for marginally better policies, as their vote there has a far smaller chance of making an impact.

But *block voting* is not the only sinister strategy in democracies. E.g. supporting a multitude of opposition parties to split the vote, yielding in much fewer *essentials* is also a viable strategy, as splitting the vote means much fewer are needed to vote for the winning party. This leads to the possibility of targeted bribing of communities most important to the survival of the ruling party. 

### Key claims
- Building a small and loyal coalition is very important for autocrats to stay in power
- Competent supporters also mean competent rivals, potentially leading to shorter tenure.
- Bloc voting changes incentive structures in democracies such that they resemble systems with far fewer *essentials*
- One reason why democratic governments and publicly traded companies work well for their constituents is, that the leaders are incentivised to provide public goods
- Democrats have a higher chance to survive the first months in office, but autocrats are by far more likely to survive decades in office. 

### Key examples

(i) Carly Fiorina and how to stay in power as a CEO. Carly Fiorina was an outsider rising to the top of HP leadership. The decimated the board that once selected her, while at the same time sinking the stock price of HP. Since the largest stakeholders were pissed off, because their fortunes were dwindling, Fiorina had to stage a merger with a different company (Compaq), changing board composition again, and to sharply increase pay for members of the board. This was not good for her, as it bought her at least a few additional years as CEO, but not good for the stock prices, plummeted after the merger. 
Once, she was finally fired, she was replaced with Mark Hurd, under whom HP performed much better, but who also had a much shorter tenure, presumably because he did not understand board management as well as Fiorina. 

(ii) Saddam Hussein and competent supporters. Shortly after getting into power, Saddam Hussein purged the Ba'ath party of 450 officials, many of whom highly educated and supporters of Hussein since the first hour. He replaced them mostly with members of his tribe or family, such as Ali Hassan Al-Majid (Hussein's cousin), also called "Chemical Ali", who completely uneducated, but very loyal (and brutal), being responsible for atrocities committed against the kurds.

(iii) Northern India and fair and transparent elections. In northern indian states (Bihar and Utar Pradesh) have very interesting forms of bloc voting, also known as *booth capture*, where party supporters capture a polling place and cast every possible vote for their party

(iv) Utar Pradesh and unusual coalitions. Also in Utar Pradesh, confusing coalitions take place in order to gain power. As such, expliciterly anti-communist parties such as the Swatantra Party (free-markt) and Jana Sangh Party (socially conservative) formed a coalition with the Communist Party in 1967, despite the fact that Swatantra's officials often called the members of the Communist Party "public enemy number 1". This happened, because they all wanted to come into power to replace the Congress Party. 

(v) Bihar and how to secure mining rights. The Raja of Ramgarh, owner of most of the mining rights in Bihar, personally was responsible for a lot of electoral turmoil. He controlled such a large bloc of voters, that him switching parties meant the rise or fall of a given coalition. He used this privilege thouroughly, as he often changed parties, leading to changes in government in Bihar. He allegedly also used this tactic to have criminal charges against him dismissed.

(vi) Afghanistan and how to buy an election. Apparently in 2010, votes in Afghanistan went for 5-6$ per vote. A rough fermi calculation yields: \~6.5 million voters (for presidential election 2014) * 1/2 (you need \~half of them to win) * 5.5$ =\~ 18 million $ to elect the next president of Afghanistan. 

### Key passages

On benefits in business management:
>Involvement in a corporation can yield benefits, just like any other form of government. These benefits can take the form of rewards given to everyone or private payments directed just to the essentials. In a corporate setting, private benefits typically come as personal compensation in the form of salary, perks and stock options. Rewards to everyone -- what economists call "public goods" -- take the shape of dividends (an equal amount per share) and increased stock value. When the winning coalition is sufficiently large that private rewards are an inefficient way for the CEO to buy the loyalty of essentials, public goods tend to be the benefit of choice. Usually coalition members are eager to receive private benefits. However, dividends and growth in share value are preferred over private rewards by very large shareholders who happen also to be in the winning coalition -- this would make them the biggest recipient of the rewards that go to all shareholders.

On bloc voting:
>Bloc voting takes seemingly democratic institutions and makes them appear like publicly traded companies. Every voter or share has a nominal right to vote, but effectively all power lies with a few key actors who can control large shares or deliver many votes from their village. Bloc voting makes nominally democratic systems with large coalitions function as if they are autocratic by making the number of influentials -- that is, people whose choices actually matter -- much smaller than the nominal selectorate of the rest of the voters.

Again on bloc voting:
>Bribing voters works far better at the bloc level. Suppose there are just three villages and suppose a party, call it party A, negotiates with senior community figures in the villages and makes the following offer: if party A wins it will build a hospital (or road, pick up the trash, send police patrols, plow the snow, and so on) in the most supportive of the three villages. Once a village elder declares for party A, voters in that village can do little better than support party A, even if they don't like it. The reality is that there are so many voters that the chance that any individual vote matters is inconsequential. Yet, voters are much more consequential about where the hospital gets built or whose streets get swept than they are about who wins the election. 

On differential survival densities between autocrats and democrats.
>Although autocrats survive longer, they find surviving the initial period in office particularly difficult. During their first half year they are nearly twice as likely to be deposed as their democratic counterparts. However, if they survive those first tubulent months, then they have a much better chance of staying in power than democrats. Those early months are difficults because the have not yet worked oyt where the money is, making them unreliable sources of wealth for their coalition, and they have yet to work out whose support they really need and who they can dump from the transitional coalition. But once autocrats have reshaped and purged their supporters, survival becomes easiert. Democrats, in contrast, are constantly engaged in a battle for the best policy ideas to keep their large constituencies happy. As a result, although democrats survive the ealry months in office more easily (they get a honeymoon), the perpetual quest for good policy takes a toll, such that only 4 percent of democrats survive in office for ten or more years. Nearly three times as many autocrats manage to accomplish this feat, 11 percent. 

## Chapter 4: Steal from the poor, give to the rich

A bunch of different ideas regarding fund-raising and taxation in autocratic regimes are discussed. 

An important take away is that rulers are incentivized to tax a maximum amount, since it secures them the job (as they can re-route the money to the *essentials*). 

They are constrained by three major factors, namely

(i) taxes on fruits of labor markedly reduces the incentive of the one taxed to work hard.

(ii) parts of the burden of taxation lies upon the *essentials*, limiting the amount that autocrats can tax without impunity

(iii) tax collection is a difficult task.

The main argument here is that for small-coalition systems, the most likely constraint is (i), as it limits the ability to extract money from the *interchangables* to give to the *essentials*. This is because at some point, there are no fruits of labor anymore for a government to take.

In contrast, for large-coalition systems, the most likely constraint is (i), as people do not like to be taxed into oblivion and can be readily convinced to vote for someone promising them to not tax them anymore. 

Next to this, a few more points are mentioned:

Obviously autocrats want their cash-flow to be as intransparent as possible, as it limits other players to pay supporters after a *coup*. Democrats are more interested in transparent systems, because this makes them less likely to be ousted by someone just promising, they will make it better. 

Regarding the issue of resources, dM/A pretty much state that natural resources are terrible for people, as it makes them entirely expandable for securing state funding. In a system where the state's funding is dependent on labor, the level of extraction is limited by the diminishing production under high-taxation regimes. If a state has the authority over natural resources that can be extracted with minimal labor (such as oil), there is little incentive of a ruler to care about the welfare and production capacity of his inferiors, such that very resource-rich countries end up very poor. 

Personal note: I think this theory (also discussed elsewhere --  maybe even better), has great explanatory power, specifically regarding the question why *first-comers*, i.e. Western Europe, United States did not go through the *resource curse*. If you imagine 19th century Western Europe, much coal and steel could be produced, but the actual creation of wealth happened in plants producing industrial goods with them. This is no different today, but the scales of the global economy have increased enormously, making the amount of money involved in the natural resources found in a small country in sub-saharan Africa significant for the whole economy. In the 19th century, there was no global economy and the real money was not ithen resources, such that the *resource curse* never happened. 

Regarding debt, dM/A make the point, that it is much better understood as an indirect form of taxation of future *interchangables*, making it extremely attractive to autocrats. This is potentiated by the following calculation: In democracies, taking on more debt is limited by the amount the people are willing to pay back and later political costs of not being able to provide large-scale social programs, because the amount of money needed to service the debt becomes too high. In autocracies, this is not a likely constraint, as debt is largely paid by the many and the money borrowed is likely to end up in the pockets of the few. Thus, the most likely constraint is the market's willingness to lend money, usually determined by the amount of collateral a state can provide. This of course means, that it is very good policy for an autocrat to take on the maximum amount of debt, since it ties the hands of competitors: if you maxed out the amount of money the market is willing to lend you, no competitor can promise their followers that they will just take on more debt to pay for spoils.

This is also a likely reason, why debt relief has not worked well so far: it doesn't remove the incentive of autocrats to take on more debt, leading to a quick bounce-back to usual levels of indebtedness -- the maximum. 

Following from the point regarding debt and the point regarding resources, there is another interesting take:
The reason why resource-rich countries are often more indebted than their neighbors is that resources can be used as collaterals for loans, leading to the paradox that more revenue is also associated with higher levels of debt. 

### Key claims

- Leaders have an incentive to tax the maximum amount
- There are three key constraints, (i) taxation desincentivizes labour, (ii) taxation means a burden to supporters, (iii) tax collection is difficult
- In democracies, the key constraint is the burden to the *essentials*
- In autocracies, the key constraint is the desincentivization of labour
- The reason why the *resource curse* exist is, because it removes key constraints placed onto autocrats extraction behaviour
- Autocrats want to take on the maximum of debt, because they want to (a) extract and taking on debt is a form of taxation, and (b) it constrains potential ursurpers.
- Debt relief does not work well if the incentives for autocrats to take on debt are left in place. 

### Key examples

(i) Mexico and the impact of democratization on taxes. There is an eerie correlation of Mexicos democratization efforts in the late 90, culminating in the loss of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional in 2000 and a steadily falling effective tax rate.

(ii) Marketing Boards in Ghana and the impact of indirect taxation. In Ghana, a common form of indirect taxation happened to cacoa farmers through the "Cacoa Marketing Board", where the government would set prices for cacoa, forcing farmers to sell for this price, distribute the cacoa on the world market for a higher price and pocket the difference. In the 1980s this lead to a complete collapse of cacoa production in Ghana. 

(iii) The caliphate and how to do missionary right. The Caliphate (as in the muslim empire established after the death of Mohammmad) had an interesting way to tax: the caliph would license the right to collect taxes in certain regions to tax collectors, who would have any incentive to extract the maximum amount possible from these regions. Since muslims were excempted (at least at first), the brutal strategies of the tax collectors lead many non-muslims to give up on their native religion and convert to islam. 

(iv) Nigeria and the resource curse. When oil was found in Nigeria, the total debt levels went up, while poverty even increased. This is key evidence that resources, which can be extracted with minimal labour (a) increase debt level (see above) and (b) make it even worse for the population

(v) The IMF/World Bank program for "Heavily indebted poor countries" was a complete disaster as almost all countries involved in the debt relieve, immediately started to take on new debt

### Key passages 

On taxing to stay in power
>Ruling is about staying in power, not about good governance. To this end, leaders buy support by rewarding their essential backers relative to others. TAxation plays a dual role in generating this kind of loyalty. First it provides leaders with the resources to enrich their most essential supporters. Second, it reduces the welfare of those outside of the coalition

On implicit tax rates
> [...E]ven when nominal [tax] rates are low, autocracies have high implicit taxes -- if you have something valuable then it simply gets taken.
