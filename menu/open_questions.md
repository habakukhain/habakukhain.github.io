This is work in progress. In the end this is supposed to be a repository of questions I have once asked myself and haven't figured out a good answer to yet.

### Is human intelligence linked to global neurotransmitter release probability?

Pretty randomly, I attended two talks in very close succession which had a very interesting theme: Certain things are known to increase the amount of neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft, which has been a well-known fact and studied for a long time. But at least in two instances of disturbances to the synaptic microcosm which lead to a higher release probability of neurotransmitters, there seems to be an improvement in cognitive function. This seems to be a surprisingly simple mechanism to enhance (human) intelligence, but there doesn't seem to be too much out there, answering this *really* interesting question.

A [paper published in 2007](https://jmg.bmj.com/content/44/6/373) describes a pretty significant increase in IQ in a family suffering from cone-rod dystrophy, a genetic condition which leads to [progressive loss of vision during adulthood](https://bjo.bmj.com/content/89/2/198). The affected Protein, Rim1Î±, is involved in organizing the pre-synapse, regulating a bunch of complicated things, including how vesicles are positioned in respect to calcium channels, the master switch for pre-synaptic activity. The equivalent mutation in mice leads to a [larger calcium current density](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/chan.4660), presumably leading to a higher chance of individual neurotransmitter-containing vesicles being released.
