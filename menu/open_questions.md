### Is human intelligence linked to global neurotransmitter release probability?

Pretty randomly, I attended two talks in very close succession which had a very interesting theme: There is a well-known fact, which has been studied for long time, that certain things increase the amount of neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft. At least in two instances of disturbances to the synaptic microcosm which lead to a higher release probability of neurotransmitters, there seems to be an improvement in cognitive function. If true, this has to be a surprisingly simple mechanism to enhance (human) intelligence. At the moment, there doesn't seem to be too much out there answering this *really* interesting question.

A [paper published in 2007](https://jmg.bmj.com/content/44/6/373) describes a pretty significant increase in IQ in a family suffering from cone-rod dystrophy, a genetic condition which leads to [progressive loss of vision during adulthood](https://bjo.bmj.com/content/89/2/198). The affected Protein, Rim1Î±, is involved in organizing the pre-synapse, regulating a bunch of complicated things, including how vesicles are positioned in respect to calcium channels, the master switch for pre-synaptic activity. The equivalent mutation in mice leads to a [larger calcium current density](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/chan.4660), presumably leading to a higher chance of individual neurotransmitter-containing vesicles being released. 

Interestingly, there is a [study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00014#) trying to figure out, why cocaine and methylphenidate (sold as Ritalin), have opposing effects on cognitive ability, i.e. cocaine decreasing and Ritalin increasing cognitive performance. 
The fact that they seemingly do the oppsitite thing is surprising, taking into account that both seem to work mainly on the same targets, namely dopamine transporters. If the effect was only one of altered motivation or a different effect of dopamine, we would expect them to do the same thing. One putative mechanism for the difference is the impact on neural lipid metabolism. With cocaine, there is an accumulation of lipids of cylindrical shape and with methylphenidate, lipids of a conical shape accumulate. Since a conical shape is beneficial to the energy balance of membrane curvature, exocytosis might be *easier* if your brain has been treated with methylphenidate.

Both stories seem to agree nicely with the hypothesis that easier release of neurotransmitter improves cognitive function, but they are far from establishing a realistic model or even showing convincingly that increased release probability is indeed the only explanation for these observations.

Next to the fact that these findings are not conclusive, I am also uncertain how they fit into a [critical brain model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_brain_hypothesis), since just randomly increasing release probability should bring the brain closer to criticality, resulting in seizures. This is the same line of thinking leading to the use [Ca<sub>v</sub> 2.1 inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin#Pharmacodynamics)  as anti-seizure medication.

I'd be really interested to read more about this. If you come across any technical articles describing similar effects or have any idea, how to test this in an experimental way, please contact me.

### Why are autocrats trying to get huge sport events to take place in their country

Autocrats seem to be really interested in hosting huge sport events (e.g. Olympics, FIFA world cup, etc). Why is this?

In my understanding, these things cost a lot of money, fail to improve the economy sustainably, are ususally pretty unpopular with the locals and give a lot of publicity to everybody discovering something bad or terrible about the government. 

Is prestige really so impotant to autocrats? Are huge events and the associated infrastructure spending a good way to bribe powerful political and economic players? Am I wrong about local economic effects?
